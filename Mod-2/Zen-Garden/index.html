            <h3>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTEMENT</h3>
            <P>
                Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <span
                    class="dotted">DOM</span>s,
                broken <span class="dotted">CSS</span> support, and abandoned browsers.
            </p>
            We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless
            efforts of folk like the <span class="dotted">W3C</span>, <span class="dotted">WASP</span>, and the major
            browser creators.
            <p>
                The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin
                to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion.
                Become
                one with the web.
            </p>

            <h3>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h3>
            <p>
                There is a continuing need to show the power of <span class="dotted">CSS</span>. The Zen Garden aims to
                excite, inspire, and
                encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any
                one
                will load the style sheet into this very page. The <span class="dotted">HTML</span> remains the same,
                the only thing that has
                changed is the external <span class="dotted">CSS</span> file. Yes, really.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="dotted">CSS</span> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext
                document. The only way this can
                be
                illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the
                reins
                are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike
                have
                contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

            <h3>PARTICIPATION</h3>
            <p>
                Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <span
                    class="dotted">CSS</span> skills
                are
                necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even <span class="dotted">CSS</span>
                novices can use them as
                starting points. Please see the <a href=""><span class="dotted">CSS</span> Resource Guide</a> for
                advanced tutorials and tips on working with
                <span class="dotted">CSS</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem daunting at
                first if
                you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample
                files
                as a guide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Download the sample <a href="">HTML</a> and <a href="">CSS</a> to work on a copy locally. Once you have
                completed your masterpiece
                (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your <span class="dotted">CSS</span> file to a web
                server under your
                control.
                <a href="">Send us a link</a> to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to
                use it we
                will
                download it and place it on our server.

            <h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>
            <p>
                Where possible, we would like to see mostly <span class="dotted">CSS 1 & 2</span> usage. <span
                    class="dotted">CSS 3 & 4</span> should be limited to
                widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about
                functional, practical <span class="dotted">CSS</span> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable
                by 2% of the browsing
                public.
                The only real requirement we have is that your <span class="dotted">CSS</span> validates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <span
                    class="dotted">CSS</span> by now. When
                sticking
                to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the
                sheer
                number of user agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect
                layouts may not be possible across every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can.
                Your
                design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by
                over 90% of the population).
            </p>
            <p>
                We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable
                material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work.
                We’re
                well past the point of needing another garden-related design.
            </p>

                Commons
                license identical to the <a href="">one on this site</a> so that others may learn from your work.
